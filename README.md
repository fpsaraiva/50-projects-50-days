# 50-projects-50-days

Este reposit√≥rio cont√©m os projetos realizados no curso da Udemy [50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript](https://50projects50days.com/), dos autores Brad Traversy e Florin Pop.

Meu objetivo √© realizar 1 projeto por dia, apenas em dias da semana, durante 10 semanas.

A ideia foi praticar conceitos de programa√ß√£o que tenho aprendido recentemente e criar uma rotina de programa√ß√£o, atrav√©s da aplica√ß√£o de conhecimento em pequenos projetos reais. Na maior parte dos exerc√≠cios segui os requisitos originais, com pequenas altera√ß√µes (aqui e ali) visuais.

## üá∫üá∏

This repository contains projects developed within Brad Traversy and Florin Pop [50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript](https://50projects50days.com/) Udemy's course.

My goal is to execute 1 project a day (week days only) for 10 weeks.

The idea was to twofold: put into practice programming concepts that I've been learning recently and create a programming routine, by applying knowledge into small real life projects. In most cases, I've followed the original requirements, except for a few visual tweaks here and there.
